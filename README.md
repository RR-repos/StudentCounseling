Web Application approach to Identification of student counseling needs

In the current era, students are facing a lot of pressure to compete in the rapidly evolving technology and high demands. Due to this pressure, students are experiencing  tremendous stress resulting in physical and psychological issues, some of the students are prone to depression and are commiting suicides. In spite, there is no professional help to tackle these issues. In order to help cope with this situation, the government has initiated mandatory mentoring programmes in all colleges and universities. Since, the faculty are not trained to handle student problems especially psychological by counseling, an app developed under professional guidance that can help the faculty in the mentoring process would be very useful, this miniproject aims to develop an app that can identify student counseling needs and also offer certain counseling tips.
